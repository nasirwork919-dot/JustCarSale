# JustCarSale.com

## Overview
JustCarSale is a professional automotive marketplace and services platform (originally built in Google AI Studio). It's a React + Vite single-page application with a production Express + Prisma + PostgreSQL backend providing authentication and (growing) domain APIs, plus a small photo-sync/health endpoint in the frontend server.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React 19 + TypeScript, Vite 6, Tailwind CSS 4, Framer Motion (`motion`), lucide-react icons
- Frontend server: Express 4 (TypeScript, run via `tsx`) — serves the Vite dev middleware in development and static build output in production; also hosts the photo-sync/health endpoints and proxies `/api/*` to the backend
- Backend: Express 4 + TypeScript + Prisma ORM + PostgreSQL (Replit's built-in database), run via `tsx` on `localhost` only (not exposed to the public port)
- Auth: JWT (7-day expiry) + bcrypt password hashing

## Project Structure
- `server.ts` — Frontend Express server entry point (dev: Vite middleware mode; prod: serves `dist/`). Also proxies `/api/*` (except its own `/api/photo-sync/*` and `/api/health`) to the backend on `localhost:3001`.
- `server/` — Backend service: `index.ts` (entry point), `routes/`, `controllers/`, `middleware/`, `services/`, `utils/`, `prisma/schema.prisma`, `prisma/seed.ts`
- `src/` — React app source (`App.tsx`, `components/`, `data.ts`, `types.ts`) — frontend only, not touched by backend work
- `index.html` / `src/main.tsx` — Vite entry points
- `vite.config.ts` — Vite config (React + Tailwind plugins, dev server bound to `0.0.0.0` with `allowedHosts: true` for Replit's proxied preview)

## Backend Architecture
- Two Express processes run together under one workflow via `concurrently` (`npm run dev` = `dev:frontend` + `dev:backend`): frontend on `0.0.0.0:5000` (the only public/webview port), backend on `localhost:3001` (internal only).
- The frontend's `server.ts` forwards all other `/api/*` traffic to the backend using `http-proxy-middleware`. Two non-obvious fixes were required for this proxy to work correctly — see `.agents/memory/express-proxy-backend.md`.
- Database: PostgreSQL via Prisma. Schema in `server/prisma/schema.prisma` covers Users, BusinessProfiles (with country/city + indexes), Vehicles (heavily indexed for search/filter), VehiclePhotos, Auctions, Bids, TransportRequests/Offers, Inspections, InsurancePolicies, Claims, OwnershipTransfers, StolenReports, Messages, Reviews (unique per reviewer+business), Bookings, Notifications, SpareParts, Documents, plus email verification / password reset tokens.
- Auth endpoints (all under `/api/auth`): `register`, `login`, `verify-email`, `forgot-password`, `reset-password`, `me` (JWT-protected), `complete-profile` (JWT-protected), `select-role` (JWT-protected; BUSINESS/INSURANCE/WORKSHOP/LOGISTICS upgrades are recorded as a pending notification requiring admin approval, not applied immediately).
- Vehicle & marketplace endpoints: full CRUD under `/api/vehicles` (search/filter/sort/paginate, photo sub-resource, status updates, soft delete, owner-only mutations), `/api/marketplace` (stats, featured, makes, recent), `/api/businesses` (CRUD, slug lookup, vehicles-by-business, `my-business`), nested `/api/businesses/:id/reviews` plus standalone `DELETE /api/reviews/:id`, and `/api/bookings` (create, my-bookings, business-bookings, status updates restricted to booking creator or business owner). All responses follow `{ success, data }` / `{ success: false, error }` with `{ meta: { page, limit, total, totalPages } }` on paginated list endpoints.
- Auctions/services endpoints (Step 3):
  - `/api/auctions` — list/filter/sort, get by id, create (owner of a vehicle), place bid (`POST /:id/bids`, rejects own-auction and below-minimum-increment bids), close auction.
  - `/api/transport` — create request (`vehicleId` optional), list/filter, `my-requests`, `my-offers`, submit offer (`POST /:id/offers`, rejects offers on your own request), accept offer (`PATCH /offers/:id/accept`), update request status (carrier-only).
  - `/api/vin/:vin` — public lookup (vehicles + inspections + transfers + stolen reports + policies), `/:vin/fraud-score` (weighted score from stolen reports/failed inspections/transfers/mileage jumps), `/:vin/stolen`, `/:vin/inspections`.
  - `/api/inspections` — create restricted to GOVERNMENT/WORKSHOP roles (no dedicated INSPECTOR role exists in the schema; WORKSHOP is used as an inspector proxy), list/filter, get by id.
  - `/api/insurance/policies` — create/list (owner or INSURANCE role), `/api/insurance/claims` — create (policy owner), list, get by id, `PATCH /:id/status` restricted to INSURANCE role.
  - `/api/transfers` — create (current owner initiates, `fromUserId` = requester), `PATCH /:id/confirm` (recipient-only; flips vehicle `sellerId` to the new owner on confirm), list/filter.
  - `/api/stolen-reports` — file report (any authenticated user, auto-sets vehicle status to `FLAGGED`), list all restricted to GOVERNMENT/POLICE roles, `PATCH /:id/status` restricted to POLICE role only (GOVERNMENT can view but not update status).
- Messaging/notifications/parts/documents endpoints (Step 4):
  - `/api/messages` — `POST /` send (rejects self-messaging, optional `vehicleId`, triggers a `NEW_MESSAGE` notification to the receiver), `GET /conversations` (grouped by other user with `unreadCount` + last message), `GET /conversation/:userId` (paginated thread, optional `vehicleId` filter, marks received messages as read), `GET /unread-count`, `DELETE /:id` (sender-only).
  - `/api/notifications` — `GET /` (paginated, filter by `read`/`type`), `PATCH /:id/read`, `PATCH /read-all`, `GET /unread-count`, `DELETE /:id` (all owner-scoped). `server/services/notificationService.ts` exports `createNotification(userId, type, title, message, link?)`, wired into: new bid, auction ended (lazily closed on `GET /api/auctions` / `GET /api/auctions/:id` when `endTime` has passed — notifies seller + winning bidder + losing bidders), new transport offer, transport offer accepted, new message, new review, booking status changed, ownership transfer initiated, stolen report filed (vehicle flagged), insurance claim status updated.
  - `/api/spare-parts` — `POST /` create (restricted to a business profile with `businessType: DISMANTLER` owned by the caller), `GET /` public search/filter (name, oem, condition, price range, `compatibleVin`), `GET /:id`, `PUT /:id` / `DELETE /:id` (owner-only), `GET /my-parts`, `GET /compatible/:vin`.
  - `/api/documents` — auth-scoped CRUD (`POST /`, `GET /` filterable by `type`/`vehicleId`, `GET /:id`, `DELETE /:id`), optionally linked to a `vehicleId`.
- `requireAuth` / `requireRole(...)` middleware in `server/middleware/auth.ts` protect routes.
- Email sending is currently a console-log stub (`server/services/emailService.ts`) — no email provider is configured yet.
- Seed data: `npm run prisma:seed` creates 5 users (one per PERSONAL/BUSINESS/INSURANCE/WORKSHOP/GOVERNMENT role, password `Password123!`), 6 business profiles (incl. one DISMANTLER), 30 vehicles (20 base + 10 with photos), 5 auctions, 4-5 reviews, 3 inspections, 3 insurance policies (upsert by `policyNumber`), 2 ownership transfers, 1 stolen report (auto-flags its vehicle), 5 spare parts with compatible VINs (upsert by `oem`), 10 messages, 5 notifications.
- Useful scripts: `npm run prisma:generate`, `npm run prisma:migrate`, `npm run prisma:seed`.
- Note: `prisma migrate dev` requires an interactive TTY and fails in this environment ("non-interactive" error) even with `CI=true`. See `.agents/memory/prisma-migrations-in-replit.md` for the manual migration workflow used instead.

## Replit Environment Setup
- Workflow "Start application" runs `npm run dev`, which starts both the frontend (port 5000, 0.0.0.0) and backend (port 3001, localhost) concurrently. Port 5000 is the only port Replit's webview/proxy uses.
- Vite dev server has `host: '0.0.0.0'` and `allowedHosts: true` so it works behind Replit's iframe proxy.
- PostgreSQL database is provisioned (Replit built-in); `DATABASE_URL` and related `PG*` vars are set automatically.
- `JWT_SECRET` is set as a generated shared env var (self-generated app secret, not a user-provided credential).
- The `@google/genai` dependency and `GEMINI_API_KEY` env var are present in the template but are not currently used anywhere in the codebase.

## User Preferences
- Do not modify anything under `src/` (the React frontend) without explicit request — backend work must live in `server/`.
